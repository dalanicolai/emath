# emath.el: Toy symbolic math in Emacs Lisp

In particular, differentiation. The unit tests are the documentation.

I'm taking Robert Ghrist's [calculus class][csv] on Coursera, and got worried
doing all this differentiation in my head. Certainly using Mathematica or Maxima
is contrary to the honor code, but if I write a differentiator myself, that's
okay, right?

Released under an [MIT License][mit]. But I have no idea why anyone else would
want this. Even Emacs Calc mode does the job better.
